# User Management App

A simple React-based user management application using Material Tailwind components. The app allows for creating and updating user information.


## Features

- Create new users
- Update existing users
- Password validation
- Responsive UI using Material Tailwind

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (>= 12.x)
- npm (>= 6.x) or yarn (>= 1.x)
- A running instance of the API server (update the URL as needed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VloneMe/user-management.git
cd user-management-app 
cd either client or server directory

npm install
# or
yarn install


## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser. You can create new users, update existing ones, and perform password validation.

## API
The application interacts with an API for user management. Make sure your API server is running and accessible at http://localhost:5000/api.

## Endpoints
- GET /api/users: Fetches the list of users
- POST /api/users: Creates a new user
- PUT /api/users/:id: Updates an existing user


## Technical Stack

### Backend:
1. **Node.js**: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's lightweight, efficient, and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. In this project, Node.js will be used to create the backend server responsible for handling HTTP requests, interacting with the database, and serving data to the frontend.

2. **SQLite**: SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained SQL database engine. It's ideal for small to medium-sized applications where simplicity and ease of use are important. Since this project is relatively simple and doesn't require heavy database operations, SQLite is a perfect choice. It doesn't require a separate server process and can be directly integrated into the Node.js application.

### Frontend:
1. **React**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's component-based, which promotes reusability and maintainability of code. React's declarative approach to building UIs makes it easy to understand and work with. For this project, React will be used to create the frontend interface of the user management application.

2. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to the language. It helps catch errors early in the development process, improves code maintainability, and enhances developer productivity. Since this project aims for reliability and scalability, TypeScript is an excellent choice for writing frontend code. It provides type safety and better tooling support, especially in larger codebases.

### How it aligns with the project requirements:
1. **Simplicity**: The chosen technology stack (Node.js, SQLite, React, TypeScript) is known for its simplicity and ease of use. This aligns well with the project's requirement of developing a simple web application.

2. **Efficiency**: Node.js and SQLite are lightweight and efficient, making them suitable for small-scale applications. They provide the necessary functionalities without unnecessary overhead, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

3. **Developer Experience**: React and TypeScript improve the developer experience by offering a structured approach to building UI components and providing type safety and advanced tooling support. This helps in writing cleaner, more maintainable code and reduces the likelihood of runtime errors.

4. **Scalability**: While this project may start small, the chosen technology stack is scalable. Node.js and React are widely used in both small and large-scale applications, and TypeScript helps maintain code quality as the project grows.

In summary, the choice of Node.js, SQLite, React, and TypeScript aligns well with the project requirements by offering simplicity, efficiency, a good developer experience, and scalability. It provides the necessary tools and technologies to develop a user-friendly web application with a database backend.
